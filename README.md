# HandTrackingProject

I have begun experimenting with computer vision! 

This project uses a variety of libraries, including opencv and mediapipe

I've set up landmark tracking on my hands. I am able to tell how many fingers are raised, and when the user makes certain gestures to the camera.

This project also utilized a remote camera system. I used iOS devices as cameras, rather than the webcam. 

Some boilerplate code from this project is from the official opencv documentation, as well as from various online tutorials on hand recognition.
