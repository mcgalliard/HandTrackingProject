# HandTrackingProject

I have begun experimenting with computer vision! 

This project uses a variety of libraries, including opencv and mediapipe

I've set up landmark tracking on my hands. I am able to tell how many fingers are raised, and when the user makes certain gestures to the camera.

This project also utilized a remote camera system. I used iOS devices as cameras, rather than the webcam.
